● Create nested view(routing), as you already done one level routing. Now it’s time for nested view.  
Scenario:  
Create one level routing which having:
* Home 
* About
* Roles  

Now once user clicks on Roles, again one more nested routing should show:
* Admin
* Super Admin
* Member

Admin should be default selected view

Notes:
* Run `npm run serve` to start app
* Used Hash style URL (because typing in the path directly was not working and  
 when I refreshed the browser it redirected me to 404 page.)
